<h1>css-framework takes care of the CSS!</h1>
<p><i>Page last updated 2022-07-12</i></p>
<p>To build a website you need knowledge of basic HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of Javascript. css-framework takes care of the CSS (and that tiny bit of Javascript). Which just leaves the HTML which you can learn as you build that website.</p>
<p>Firstly we are going to give you a template and once you have changed a bit of text your website is ready. No in-depth knowledge required. All you need is a text editor. If you are using Android, I recommend Acode from the Play Store. You can see how to use Acode at <a href="https://youtu.be/295uvfXY8Q4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/295uvfXY8Q4</a></p>
<p>The template is at <a href="https://css-framework.srvr.au/template1.html" target="_blank">https://css-framework.srvr.au/template1.html</a>. You can view it and see what it looks like. Click <a href="https://css-framework.srvr.au/template1.txt" target="_blank">https://css-framework.srvr.au/template1.txt</a> to view the code. You can copy and paste the whole code into a file called index.html (all websites start with a file called index.html). Edit the title and description in the head section then all the rest of the editing is in the body section.</p>
<p>What about changing the color scheme? Simple, find the hue and saturation in the head and change the current values. A great color picker is at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp</a>. Pink has a hue of 300 and saturation of 100%. Go on make your page pink.</p>
<h2>Quick HTML Tutorial</h2>
<p>HTML is a markup language. Essentially markup uses opening and closing tags to format text. In HTML the tags are formed using less than and greater than signs. So to create a top level header we use &lt;h1&gt;My First Header&lt;/h1&gt; - h stands for header and the 1 says its the biggest font header. h1 = biggest most important header. The closing tag uses a backslash to signify its a closing tag.</p>
<p>So lets build a paragraph next &lt;p&gt;My First Paragraph&lt;/p&gt; - yes HTML is that easy.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp</a> as a great place to learn about HTML.</p>
