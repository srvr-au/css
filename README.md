# css-framework.srva.au
It's a css framework, with a little necessary JavaScript.

It's mobile first and gracefully degrades for wide screen viewing. It's material design so it holds reader interest.

Best of all you only need to input a single colour hue and saturation and it will colour your page in a pleasing manner. Saves hours.
